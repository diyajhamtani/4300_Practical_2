Here's a brief description of each component:

1. Atomicity: Each transaction must be treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database remains unchanged.

2. Consistency: A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another. Rules to ensure consistency are enforced by the database management system, such as referential integrity constraints.

3. Isolation: Concurrent execution of transactions does not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to be executed in isolation, ensuring that every transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database.

4. Durability: The effects of committed transactions are permanent and survive system failures (e.g., power outages). Once a transaction is committed, its results must persist even if the database system crashes shortly afterward."

Here is an example of how you might structure the query using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. Note that this query does not include actual data but demonstrates the structure:

```javascript
